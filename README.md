# KISS – Keep Inventories Sorted, Simple

Lightweight inventory sorting mod, an opinionated fork of [Inventory Sorting](https://modrinth.com/mod/inventory-sorting).

## Configuration

Use [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu) for GUI configuration, or the `/kiss` command alternatively.

## Usage

You can use the middle mouse button or `R` to sort the inventory you're looking at. These keybindings can be changed in
Options -> Control -> Key Binds. You can also configure the mod to **never** sort the player inventory, or to always sort both the non-player inventory (e.g. a chest you opened) and the player inventory at the same time.

While the mod is technically only required on the server, you should install it on server _and_ client. If you only
install it on the server, vanilla clients can use it via the `/kiss` commands only. Due to a [known issue with Modrinth](https://github.com/modrinth/knossos/issues/1612),
I've marked the mod as `Required` on the client.
